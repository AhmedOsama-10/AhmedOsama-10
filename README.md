### 📊 My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on (you can see more on [my portfolio](https://ahmedosama.journoportfolio.com/)):

1.  **[Customer Shopping Behavior (Python EDA)](https://github.com/AhmedOsama-10/YOUR-REPO-NAME-HERE)**
    - Performed a full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on 99k+ customer transactions using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
    - Cleaned data, engineered new features (like age groups), and visualized key insights, such as top-selling categories and demographic spending habits.

3.  **[End-to-End Sales Analysis (SQL + Power BI)](https://github.com/AhmedOsama-10/YOUR-REPO-NAME-HERE)**
    - Used advanced SQL (Window Functions, CTEs) to pre-process and analyze sales data.
    - Created SQL Views for customer/product segmentation and connected them to Power BI to build a 3-page executive dashboard (tracking 12+ KPIs).

4.  **[Coffee Machine Sales (Power BI)](https://github.com/AhmedOsama-10/YOUR-REPO-NAME-HERE)**
    - Built a dashboard to analyze coffee sales, comparing performance on weekends vs. normal days and identifying peak sales hours.
