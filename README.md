### 📊 My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on (you can see more on [my portfolio](https://ahmedosama.journoportfolio.com/)):

1.  **[Customer Shopping Behavior (Python EDA)](https://github.com/AhmedOsama-10/customer_shopping_mall)**
    - Performed a full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on 99k+ customer transactions using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
    - Cleaned data, engineered new features (like age groups), and visualized key insights, such as top-selling categories and demographic spending habits.

2.  **[E-commerce Sales Analysis (Power BI)](https://github.com/AhmedOsama-10/E-commerce-Transactions-Analysis)**
    - Analyzed 1 million e-commerce transactions using Power BI.
    - Designed a 6-table Star Schema data model and built a 6-page interactive dashboard with advanced DAX measures (YOY%, QOQ%, MOM%) and geographic drill-downs.

3.  **[End-to-End Sales Analysis (Advanced SQL + Power BI)](https://github.com/AhmedOsama-10/Advanced-SQL-for-Sales-Performance-Analysis-Reporting-View-Creation)**
    - Used advanced SQL (Window Functions, CTEs) to pre-process and analyze sales data.
    - Created SQL Views for customer/product segmentation and connected them to Power BI to build a 3-page executive dashboard (tracking 12+ KPIs).

4.  **[Coffee Machine Sales (Power BI)](https://github.com/AhmedOsama-10/Coffee-Machine-Sales-Analysis)**
    - Built a dashboard to analyze coffee sales, comparing performance on weekends vs. normal days and identifying peak sales hours.
    - Conducted Pareto (80/20) analysis, revealing that 97% of sales came from just 7 products.

5.  **[Foundational Sales Data Analysis (SQL EDA)](https://github.com/AhmedOsama-10/EDA-using-SQL)**
    - Applied fundamental SQL queries (JOINS, GROUP BY, AGGREGATIONS) to perform an initial exploration of a sales database.
    - Calculated key business metrics (e.g., total sales, order count) and identified the Top 5 performing products, sub-categories, and Top 10 customers.
